Interview Homework

Task 1
This is a script that loads the last occurrence in the configuration file /tmp/foobar and compares
whether the last entry is greater than or equal to 10

Task 2
Contains test scenarios to test the implemented function foobar_foo_gte_10.
Each test scenario tests one use case.
After the test scenario is completed, all changes made by the tests are reverted to their original state.

To run this projet create a configuration file '/tmp/foobar' that contains the following entry:
Foo = 10

Bar="hello world"

Foobar=0
